noise.js will kill you
======================
An experiment with the new Web Audio API for ambient noise synthesis. It's like acid for the brain if you're in the right mood.

supported noise
---------------
+ White/Pink/Brown noise
+ Binaural beats

platform goals
--------------
Ambience can be abstracted to a noise that lasts infinitely long, and may or may not be procedurally generated.

`noise.js` should be a solid platform for this type of sound. Not only one of these sounds, but any number of them played at the same time. The only limit should be the CPU.
